    "## Model Training Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (`yes` or `no`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens in simple steps\n",
    "1. Load the dataset.\n",
    "2. Split the data into inputs (`X`) and target (`y`).\n",
    "3. Split into training and testing sets with balanced classes.\n",
    "4. Convert text columns to numbers safely using a preprocessing pipeline.\n",
    "5. Train a fast Logistic Regression model.\n",
    "6. Measure accuracy on unseen test data.\n",
    "7. Try a faster hyperparameter search to improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Load data\n",
    "- `pd.read_csv(..., sep=';')` reads the CSV file.\n",
    "- We use `sep=';'` because this file uses semicolons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create features and target\n",
    "- `X = df.drop(columns=['y'])` keeps all input columns.\n",
    "- `y = df['y'].map({'no': 0, 'yes': 1})` converts labels to numbers.\n",
    "  - `0` = no subscription\n",
    "  - `1` = subscription\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Fast and balanced train/test split\n",
    "- `train_test_split(..., test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42)` does an 80/20 split.\n",
    "- `stratify=y` keeps class proportions similar in train and test.\n",
    "- This is simpler and faster than manual index splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Convert text to numeric (without leakage)\n",
    "- The model cannot learn from raw text directly.\n",
    "- `OneHotEncoder` turns categories (job, month, etc.) into numeric columns.\n",
    "- `ColumnTransformer` applies encoding only to categorical columns.\n",
    "- `Pipeline` keeps preprocessing + model together in one clean workflow.\n",
    "- `handle_unknown='ignore'` avoids errors if a new category appears in test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Train the baseline model\n",
    "- We use `LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', max_iter=200)` for fast binary classification.\n",
    "- `model.fit(X_train_raw, y_train)` learns from the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Evaluate model quality\n",
    "- `model.predict(X_test_raw)` makes predictions on unseen data.\n",
    "- `accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)` gives the percentage of correct predictions.\n",
    "- Accuracy around **0.91** means about **91%** of predictions are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Faster hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Instead of trying every combination (Grid Search), we use `RandomizedSearchCV`.\n",
    "- It tests a small random set of good parameter candidates (`n_iter=6`, `cv=3`).\n",
    "- This usually gives strong results in much less time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this approach is better\n",
    "- Faster training and tuning.\n",
    "- Cleaner code with one pipeline.\n",
    "- Lower risk of preprocessing mistakes.\n",
    "- Good accuracy with less compute time."

    "## Pros and Cons of This RandomizedSearchCV Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "- Faster than full GridSearchCV because it tests only a random subset of combinations (`n_iter=8`).\n",
    "- Good coverage across scales of regularization strength using `np.logspace(-2, 2, 10)` for `C`.\n",
    "- Uses cross-validation (`cv=3`), so parameter choice is more reliable than a single train/validation split.\n",
    "- Reproducible results due to `random_state=42`.\n",
    "- Efficient runtime with parallel processing (`n_jobs=-1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "- May miss the true best combination because it does not evaluate every possible parameter set.\n",
    "- With only 8 iterations, search depth is limited for larger parameter spaces.\n",
    "- `cv=3` is faster but less stable than higher folds (e.g., 5-fold) for noisy data.\n",
    "- Restricting to one solver (`liblinear`) and one penalty (`l2`) reduces exploration breadth.\n",
    "- Accuracy-only optimization may overlook other useful metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC) depending on business goals."
